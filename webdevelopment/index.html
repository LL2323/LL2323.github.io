    <h3>Welcome</h3>
    <p>Hello! My name is Landen Lipskoch, and I am an Information Technology major studying at the University of Mizzou.</p>

    <h3>Purpose and Goals</h3>
    <p>
      This website will be the central point of how I can demonstrate my IT career resume and portfolio. 
      It will showcase my past and present professional experience, skills, and achievements to give employers 
      and visitors a clear understanding of my professional background. The aim of this website is to make my 
      work easily accessible so that potential employers and anyone interested in working with me can quickly 
      gain insight into my capabilities. I will be sharing my projects, education, and experiences to highlight 
      my strengths and professional growth. This website also represents my personality—showcasing my dedication, 
      skills, and commitment to learning and self‑improvement.
